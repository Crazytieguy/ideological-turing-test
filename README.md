# Ideological Turing Test

This is a multiplayer online game built for the Democrathon (hackathon for Israeli democracy).

It allows players to answer political questions and then attempt to impersonate other players using a short description of their political views. Finally, players try to guess which answer is authentic and which one is an impersonation.

The hope is that by incentivising good impersonation, people with different political views will be encouraged to genuinely understand each other better instead of fighting.

The code is based on a [trpc example](https://github.com/trpc/examples-next-prisma-websockets-starter).
